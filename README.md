# Heart_disease_ML
UofT APS360 Project repository.

Made by Cheng Cao, Ferdinand Tonby-Strandborg.
Completed 9 April 2021.

Project desciption:
To produce a machine learning model that can predict heart disease in patients given 13 inputs.
All data was taken from the following UCI dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease

"Final Binary Model" is final edited code.
Final model performance included above 90% accuracy on training, validation data; 75% accuracy on testing data.

Instructions for using code:
Save csv file "New data" to google drive.
Update directory in code to train/produce model on "New data" csv file.

The majority of data viable data is in "New data".
All data in "New data" is from the Cleveland database contained in the UCI link above.

Another file, "VA" is also being added, it contains only viable data we found not contained in "New data".

Another code is provided for our Multi-Class Model work, it was not used in the end due to issues from the size of data used, and data balancing issues faced.
As such model performance included training accuracy up to 100%; validation accuracy no higher than around 60%.
